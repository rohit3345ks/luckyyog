       <p> Although originating in India around 4,000 years ago,
             yoga is more popular than ever offering a practitioner so much more than a way 
             to stay flexible and fit.  <br><br>
           <i class="highlight"> What is Yoga?</i><br><br>
            There is a popular misconception of yoga as a practice confined to
             extremely athletic people intent on bending themselves into various 
             contortions that many of us would find impossible. While experienced
             practitioners can and do hold seemingly reality defying poses, thereby
              view of yoga as an activity suited only to the supremely flexible 
              falls well short of the truth. The fact is that many yoga postures 
              are easily attainable by the less fit and flexible and more advanced
               positions can be attained after diligent practise and time
                spent improvingi flexibility. In addition, yoga is more than a
                 physical discipline -it is a mental one as well - and its
                  many benefits are open to everyone who chooses to try it.
            <br><br>The Sanskrit word yoga translates as 'control' or "union' 
            referring to the balance, control and unification of the mind, body 
            and spirit of a practitioner. This concept of union and balance is the key to the benefits of practising yoga, which far surpass those of ai Simple physical fitness routine.
            Much modern medical research now agrees that the mind and the body are
             linked and the health of one affects the health of thei other.
              Positive and harmonious thoughts help to keep ailments at bay. 
              Likewise, if the body is not in balance, the mind is not in control.
               Practising yoga helps to gently stretch, purify and heal the body and
                thereby bring balance and harmony to the mind. In turn, mental 
            balance and harmony bring health, happiness and fulfilment.

        <h2 class="text-center text-capitalize headingpara">principles of yoga</h2>

     <p> 
      Essentially. yoga is an art, science and philosophy of life as well as a 
      physical discipline. The origins of yoga date back to India three to four
       thousand years ago, when it is believed that the great sages of ancient 
       India developed the wisdom known as "the supreme science of life". This body of knowledge,
        when practised through the system of yoga, can lead to greater health, 
        mental control and, ultimately. self-realisation. 
        It is no coincidence that spiritual movements such as Buddhism and Hinduism
        have borrowed heavily on the practices and postures of yoga.
        Today, there are many forms of yoga, but 'hatha yoga' is the one most
         commonly practised in the West. Hatha yoga concentrates on the 
         physical body as the way towards self-realisation. It teaches us that 
         gaining control over the body is the key to controlling the mind.
          Hatha yoga's emphasis on the physical helps to focus the mind and 
          improve concentration and is therefore perfect for helping the more
           mental and spiritual practice of meditation. The postures, or asanas,
           in this book are the essential poses and exercises taught in hatha yoga.
           <br><br>
      Hatha yoga focuses on the following five main principles, designed to enhance your mental 
      and physical health and well-being. 
      <br><br>
    
      <li class="check"><b> Relaxation: </b>Yoga practice rests your entire body and releases tension in your muscles. Exercise followed by relaxation dislodges blockages in your system and restores the body's normal energy flow. It also helps to calm the mind.</li>
     <br>
      <li class="check"><b>Exercise: </b>Practising the yoga postures (or asanas) helps to stretch and tone all your muscles and strengthen your bones and ligaments. Asanas improve your circulation and keep the spine, muscles and joints more flexible. They also help to relieve depression by increasing the production and release of endorphins, which helps to improve mood and a sense of well-being.</li class="check">
      <br>
      <li class="check"><b>Breath control: </b> Using special breathing techniques (or pranayama) increases the capacity of the lungs, enabling you to breathe more fully. It also helps to strengthen the internal organs, improving mental control and your ability to relax.</li class="check">
     <br>
      <div class="check"><b> A nourishing diet:  </b>A well-balanced diet boosts the immune system, ensures better health and helps to calm the mind. As a result, your body will become more resistant to illness and disease and you will teel more healthy, with a greater sense of general well-being. </li class="check">
      <br>
      <li class="check"><b>Positive thinking and meditation: </b>This is one of the most important principles in yoga. It will train your mind to purify your thoughts by focusing on your breathing and your posture. This helps meditation, which will ultimately lead to self-realisation, the original purpose of hatha yoga.</li>

<!----------Benefits of yoga-------------------------->

    <h2 class="text-center text-capitalize headingpara">Benefits of yoga</h2>

 <p> 
 In today's ever-changing, fast moving world with its frenetic pace of life
  and financial pressures, more and more people are turning towards ancient
   ways to relieve stress and regain balance in their lives and thoughts. 
   Studies have shown that people practising yoga have experienced dramatic
   increases in lung capacity, improved ability to handle stress, and 
   reductions in body weight, cholesterol and blood-sugar levels. 
   Yoga has also been shown to help people suffering from arthritis and 
   arteriosclerosis. <br> <br>
  The main benefits of practising yoga regularly can be summarised as follows: <br> <br>

  <li class="check"><b> Improved flexibility: </b>By gradually helping you to stretch and develop your muscles, yoga improves your physical flexibility, which improves your body's efficiency and helps it to absorb physical shocks and deal with stresses. Over time, this will improve your posture and help you to move with less effort.</li class="check">
 <br>
  <li class="check"><b>Reduced stress: </b> Yoga reduces stress by relieving physical tensions in your muscles through gentle stretching. However, another key component of reducing stress, often ignored in our daily lives, is control of your breathing. Yoga uses breathing exercises to teach awareness of your breath, and to help you lengthen and deepen your breathing. Focusing on your breathing enhances relaxation and is also a useful tool for meditation.</li class="check">
  <br>
  <li class="check"><b> Heightened concentration: </b> As well as encouraging you to focus on your breathing, yoga's emphasis on attaining and holding various balancing postures, or asanas, fosters greater and more prolonged concentration with much less effort.</li class="check">
  <br>
  <li class="check"><b>Increased lung capacity: </b> Yogic breathing exercises help you to deepen your breathing and improve your lung capacity. Stretching the muscles and tissues around your ribcage and your diaphragm, and increasing the amount of air your lungs can hold. This helps to improve your intake of oxygen, as well as cleansing and purifying your lungs and helping you to relax.</li class="check">
  <br>
  <li class="check"><b>Increased strength and muscle tone: </b> Reaching and holding yogic postures employs your own bodyweight and gravity to gently stretch and exercise your muscles, improving your strength and helping your muscles to grow uniformly. Developed and toned muscles are essential for improving support and control for your body and internal organs.</li class="check">
 <br>
  <li class="check"><b> Improved posture and balance: </b>Practising yogic postures fosters balance and, together with improved muscle tone, helps you to align your body more naturally and adopt more efficient postures when you are standing, sitting, lying down, walking or exercising. Often, we adopt poor postures during our daily lives and our bodies adapt, a tight area of the body compensating for a weaker area, for instance, Regular yoga improves the alignment of your body and will put much less stress on your muscles, joints, heart and lungs and other vital organs.</li>
 <br>
  <li><b> Improved circulation and immunity: </b>Yogic exercises and breathing help to stimulate the circulation to areas of the body that you are stretching, exercising and controlling. A stronger and more relaxed body, with good circulation, also leads to improved general health.</li>
 <br>
  Additional benefits from yoga include an improved awareness of your body, better sleep, and heightened mental awareness andi strength through yoga and meditation.
  <br>
  With all of these benefits to mind and body,<b> the only question remaining is: "What are you waiting for?"</b>
